<h2>Compiling and Running the Java Applications</h2>
<p>Please download and install Java Development Kit from the 
 Oracle website, if you haven't done so already: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</p>
<br/>
<p>Once installed, launch the command line and verify that Java is installed correctly:</p>

```java
java -version
```
<p>You should see output stating the Java version installed. If you see an error, check that the JDK installed correctly and that the Java path was added to the environment variables correctly.</p>
<br/>
<p>Git clone the repository (see "Cloning an Existing Repository" here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository), and then navigate into the folder containing the problem you wish to run. For example, if you cloned into the folder C:\repos\projectEulerJava and want to run problem one, then type:</p>

```
cd C:\repos\projectEulerJava\p1MultiplesOf3And5
```

<br/>
<p>To compile the Java application, execute the following command:</p>

```java
javac Problem1.java 
```
<p>This will compile the application for the Java Virtual Machine, and create the file Problem1.class</p>

<br/>
<p>Finally, to run the Java application execute the following command:</p>

```java
java Problem1
```
<br/>
<p>Have fun!</p>
